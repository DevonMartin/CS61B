ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Overall, my code was clean and easy to read. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would pay more attention to generics and when to use them. They caused my code to be redundant in many places.
